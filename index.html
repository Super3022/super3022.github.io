            <h2>About Me:</h2>
            <p>Hello there, I'm Leigham!</p>
            <p>I am currently a First Year student at Nottingham Trent University (NTU), where I am studying a course in Cyber Security! </p>
            <p>I have always been interested in the subject of computing, and I've been studying along this pathway ever since I completed my GCSEs.</p>
            <p>I studied at Berkeley Green UTC for my GCSEs where I achieved a grade 9 for Computer Science, <br>and at Gloucester College I recieved a DDM grade for my Cyber Security BTEC course.</p>
            <p> I am continuing my studies along the Cyber Security pathway here at NTU, and I'm hoping to get a job in the sector after completing my final year here. </p>
